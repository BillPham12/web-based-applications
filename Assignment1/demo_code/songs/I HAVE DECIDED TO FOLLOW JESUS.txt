I have G decided to follow Jesus.
I have C decided to follow G Jesus.
I have decided to follow Jesus.
I can't turn D7 back, I can't turn G back.
With the cross G  before me and the world behind me.
With the cross C before me and the world G behind me.
With the cross before me and the world behind me.
I can't turn D7 back, I can't turn G back.
Chorus
Though none go with me, still I will follow.
Though none go with me, still I will follow.
Though none go with me, still I will follow.
I can't turn back, I can't turn back.
