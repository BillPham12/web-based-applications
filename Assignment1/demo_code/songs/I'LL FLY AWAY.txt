Some glad morning when this life is C7 o'er
F I'll (fly away) Fly Away (fly a-C way)
To a home on God's celestial shore
I'll (fly away) G7 Fly Away (fly a-C way).
CHORUS
C I'll (fly away) Fly Away, Oh! Glo-C7 ry
F I'll (fly away) Fly A-C way (in the morning)
When I die, Hallelujah, by and by
I'll (fly away) G7 Fly Away (fly a-C way).
When the shadows of this life has grown
I'll (fly away) Fly Away (fly away)
Like a bird from prison bars has flown
I'll (fly away) Fly Away (fly away)
