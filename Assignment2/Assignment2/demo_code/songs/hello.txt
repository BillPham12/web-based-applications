Sister Golden Hair -America 
verse1: 
Well I [E] tried to make it sunday but I [G#min] got so damned depressed 
That I [A] set my sights on [E] monday and I [G#min] got myself undressed 
I ain't [F#min] for the alter, but I [C#min] do [G#min] believe there's [A] times 
When a ready woman sure [A] can be a friend of [E] mine [Esus2] [E]
