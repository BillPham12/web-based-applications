Sister Golden Hair -America 
verse1: 
Well I tri[E]ed to make it sunday but I [G#min] got so damned depressed 
That I se[A]t my sights on [E] monday and I [G#min] got myself undressed 
I ain't ready for the alter, but I [C#min] do [G#min] believe there's [A] times 
When a woma[F#min]n sure can [A] be a friend of [E] mine [Esus2] [E]
